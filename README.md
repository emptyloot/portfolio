A personal portfolio website showcasing the intersection of **hardware diagnostics**, **operational excellence**, and **full-stack software engineering**.

This project serves as both a showcase of my work and a live demonstration of my frontend capabilities, featuring a modern, responsive design built with the **Next.js App Router**.

## 🚀 The Mission
To bridge the gap between physical hardware realities and software logic. This portfolio highlights my unique background:
